## Hello!
This is just a small github page on which I store/share anything I've made that others might find useful. Typically that's short scripts to automate otherwise tedious tasks.
They should be simple enough that you don't need support, but if you do then log it in issues! I'll also accept an email :)

In my mind this is a semi-private page, but in case you've found your way in from the internet please remember:
**Do not run programs from sources you don't know or trust!**
Quite a lot of my scripts write to files, and it's on you to make sure you don't accidentally overwrite any of your data!

## About Me:
I am an Earth Science graduate (MEarthSci) with interests in hard rock geology, petrology, metamorphism, and magmatic systems. I've also got an A-level in Comp Sci and I like to write little programs when I can to keep myself up to date. Throughout my masters there were a few opportunities to do so in a useful way, and I figured uploading them online would be the easiest way to share them for those who might encounter the same problems as me. I'm not big on super-optimising code or maintaining huge codebases so they'll be a little rough around the edges but they work as intended - it's the problem solving that's the fun bit!
