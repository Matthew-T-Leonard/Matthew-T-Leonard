## Hello!
#This is just a small github page on which I store/share anything I've made that others might find useful. Typically that's short scripts to automate otherwise tedious tasks.
#They should be simple enough you don't need support, but if you do then log it in issues! I'll also accept an email :)

#In my mind this is a semi-private page, but in case you've found your way in from the internet please remember:
## Do not run programs from sources you don't know or trust!
#Quite a lot of my scripts will read/write to files, and it's on you to make sure you don't accidentally overwrite any of your data!
